            <h4>What Is The Best Name For A Lifestyle Store?</h4>
            <p>When it comes to figuring out fashion brand names or a business name for your lifestyle store, the first detail you should iron out is your target audience.<br>

                Chalk down the characteristics of the type of consumer who will walk into your lifestyle store, and brainstorm over name ideas that will appeal to them.<br>
                
                While trying to choose a good boutique name, develop a theme that outlines what your brand represents. Once you have a few definite names in mind, <br>
                do a test run with a group of people who match your target audience to get their feedback.</p>
